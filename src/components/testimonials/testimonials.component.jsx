                <p>Getting a new SIM is often the first step when starting a business.<br /> 
                Due to the hassle, some entrepreneurs rely on their personal phone<br /> 
                numbers. What if you could get a phone number specially designed <br /> 
                for businesses like yours? Thatâ€™s why we built NativeTalk.</p>
